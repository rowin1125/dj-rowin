## Why a DJ Rowin

This was the official website of DJ Rowin

I use to be a DJ and I did this 3 times a week on average. Most of my bookings were in the club in Amsterdam, but because I wanted to promote myself also as a private party DJ I developed this website. This was a static site which was build just for SEO purpose. It had to be fast, easy to maintain and optimized for SEO.
